# Spin-Quantum-Hash â€“ Quantum-Inspired 512-bit Hash Generator

This project is a Python program that generates **Spin-Quantum-Hash**, inspired by classical hash functions.
The goal is to take a given text and deterministically produce a 512-bit hash.

---

## Features

* **Deterministic:** Always produces the same hash output for the same input.
* **Quantum-Analog:** The internal logic is designed with quantum superposition and entanglement analogies (mathematically not quantum, only an analogy).
* **512-bit Output:** The hash output is always a 512-bit value.
* **Easy to Use:** Generates a hash and analyzes it with a single text input.
* **Frequency Analysis:** Analyzes the frequency distribution of hash characters.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Numpy

Installation (Linux / macOS / Windows):

```bash
pip install numpy
```

---

## Usage

```bash
python3 spin_kuantum_hash.py
```

The program generates a hash for a default `Sample text` and performs character frequency analysis.

### Example Output

```
Input text: Sample text
hash: 3a1f5c9b... (128-character hexadecimal)
--- Character Frequency Analysis ---
'0': 10 times (7.81%)
'1': 9 times (7.03%)
...
```

## Functions

* `generate_super_hybrid_quantum_hash_v2(input_text: str) -> str`
  Takes the input text and returns a 512-bit hash value as a hexadecimal string.

* `analyze_hash_frequency(hash_string: str)`
  Calculates the frequency distribution of hash characters and prints it to the screen.

* `text_to_512_block(input_text: str) -> str`
  Converts the input text into 512-bit blocks.

* `baslangic_degeri_qthash_hybrid(blok_string: str, onceki_deger: int = 1)`
  Generates an initial value from a 512-bit block.

---

## Analogical Notes

* The code simulates **entanglement and superposition** concepts from quantum mechanics in an analog way.
* It is not a true quantum computation; it runs on classical computers.
