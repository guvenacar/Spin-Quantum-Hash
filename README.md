# Spin-Quantum-Hash
Spin-Quantum-Hash is a novel cryptographic hash algorithm using quantum mechanics. It models virtual electron spins. A classical input sets hidden spin angles, which define a superposition state. Measuring this state collapses it into a deterministic binary hash. Its immense security comes from the theoretically infinite state space of these angles
