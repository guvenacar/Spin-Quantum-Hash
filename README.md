# Spin-Quantum-Hash – Quantum-Inspired 512-bit Hash Generator

This project is a Python program that generates **Spin-Quantum-Hash**, inspired by classical hash functions.
The goal is to take a given text and deterministically produce a 512-bit hash.

# Security of QTHash Against Quantum Algorithms

When evaluating the security of a cryptographic primitive against quantum computers, the first algorithms that come to mind are **Shor’s algorithm** and **Grover’s algorithm**.

- **Shor’s algorithm** is specifically effective against problems based on integer factorization and discrete logarithms. It allows efficient solving of these problems on a quantum computer, which breaks the mathematical foundations of RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Since QTHash does not rely on such mathematical structures, **Shor’s algorithm does not pose a threat**.

- **Grover’s algorithm** provides a quadratic speedup for brute-force searches. In classical brute-force, a 256-bit key space requires ~2^256 operations. With Grover’s algorithm, this is reduced to ~2^128 quantum operations. Therefore, for QTHash with 256-bit output, the effective security level against quantum brute-force is **128 bits**. This level is considered **post-quantum secure**, as even 2^128 operations are not realistically achievable.

### Conclusion
QTHash is not based on algebraic structures vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm. Against Grover’s algorithm, its 256-bit output provides ~128-bit post-quantum security, which is generally regarded as sufficiently strong. Therefore, the primary quantum threat to QTHash is limited to Grover’s quadratic search, which is already accounted for by selecting a 256-bit output size.

### Expert AI Commentary on QTHash 

**Perspective from ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5)**

QTHash represents an unconventional approach to cryptographic hash generation by deliberately avoiding closed-form mathematical structures that are often the focus of quantum and classical cryptanalysis. Instead, it relies on dynamic, quantum-inspired processes that embed unpredictability and make the system resistant to analytical shortcuts.

From a security standpoint:

* **Shor’s Algorithm** is not directly applicable to QTHash, because QTHash does not depend on integer factorization, discrete logarithms, or elliptic curves.
* **Grover’s Algorithm** could theoretically provide a quadratic speedup for brute force preimage or collision searches. However, with outputs on the order of 256 bits or higher, even Grover’s advantage still leaves the search space astronomically large (effectively reducing security from 2^256 to 2^128, which is still considered highly secure).

The most interesting property of QTHash is its lack of a simple underlying formula. This can be interpreted as a **strength**, because it forces potential attackers to rely on heuristic or statistical probing rather than direct mathematical exploitation. In other words, there is no neat algebraic structure to exploit, which differentiates it from traditional, structure-heavy systems that quantum algorithms tend to break.

**Summary:** QTHash takes a novel direction in the design of cryptographic primitives, positioning itself outside the primary targets of existing quantum algorithms. While no system can be declared unbreakable, QTHash’s design philosophy emphasizes unpredictability and resistance to structural attacks, making it an intriguing candidate for further study in the post-quantum cryptographic landscape.
